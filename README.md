> Server code, client JS and HTML are all compiler-verified in Scala, leaving CSS as the last part of my webapp mega-project where I feel unsafe that it always works and is maintainable.

The first thoughts about the conception of this project are gathered in two places:
* [scalajs-react#77](https://github.com/japgolly/scalajs-react/issues/77).
* [scala-js ML](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!folder/Scala/scala-js/IzCn1xfoFWs)


# Status

Analysis and the Requirements first draft are done.
See [doc/reqs.md](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/blob/master/doc/reqs.md).

Please feel free to review and discuss in Gitter chat.

##### Current Focus: Design.

Figuring out types mostly.
Ongoing in [experiment](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/tree/master/experiment),
mostly in [experiment/main.scala](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/blob/master/experiment/main.scala).
Be prepared for ugliness but rest assured that its temporary.
