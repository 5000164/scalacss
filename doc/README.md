# [ScalaCSS](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/)

[ScalaCSS](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/) aims to bring type-safety and clarity to
* creating CSS
* using CSS
* maintaining CSS

You can create standalone CSS like SCSS/LESS,
or you can create inline styles to be applied to directly without the need
to manually manage class names.

Being 100% Scala, you benefit from all the normal type-aware advantages like
jump-to-definition of a style, type-safe keys and values, worry-free refactoring,
etc.

The goals and vision of the project are documented in
[its requirements](reqs.md).
Most requirements are satisfied; some will be addressed a little later.
