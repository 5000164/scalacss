## Styles

Everything is immutable in ScalaCSS
(except for [`mutable.Register`](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalacss/mutable/Register.scala)
which collects and remembers styles as you define them),
so any `StyleS`,
[`StyleF`](stylef.md),
[`StyleC`](nested.md)
can safely be used anywhere else.

`StyleA` (_applicable_ inline style) is immutable too but one of its properties
is a generated class name. If you're using inline stylesheet, class names are
generated by [`mutable.Register`](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/japgolly/scalacss/mutable/Register.scala)
so sharing them is not a good idea. Instead what you want is a reusable style module.

## Style Modules

It's often preferable to share a collection of named styles, a style _module_.

The definition of a style module is only slighty different from normal stylesheets
in that instead of defining an `object`
```scala
object MyStyles extends StyleSheet.Inline {
```
you create a class with an implicit register
```scala
class MyStyleModule(implicit r: mutable.Register) extends StyleSheet.Inline {
```

Then you use it, you simply create an instance of it inside another stylesheet.

```scala
object MyStyles extends StyleSheet.Inline {
  val shared = new MyStyleModule
}
```

That's all there is to it.
