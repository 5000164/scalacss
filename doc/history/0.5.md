# 0.5.0 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0))

* Upgrade Scala.JS to 0.6.9.
* Remove `scalacss.ext.CssReset`. It wasn't advertised and isn't appropriate here.
* Reduce size of output JS.
* Remove Scalaz as a dependency.
* Defaults no longer use PlatformJS to determine autoprefixing rules. By default, all prefixes will be generated.
  You can re-enable this in your own defaults if you want to keep using PlatformJS.
* Upgrade Scalatags to 0.5.5.
