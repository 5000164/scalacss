# 0.5.0 ([commit log](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0))

* Add negation to length & resolutions.
* Add division to length & resolutions.
* Remove `scalacss.ext.CssReset`. It wasn't advertised and isn't appropriate here.
* Reduce size of output JS.
* Remove Scalaz as a dependency.
* Defaults no longer use PlatformJS to determine autoprefixing rules. By default, all prefixes will be generated.
  You can re-enable this in your own defaults if you want to keep using PlatformJS.
* Refactor to expose less internal API.
* The following JS-only methods have been moved from the `ext-react` module to the `core` module.
  * `createStyleElement`
  * `installStyle`
  * `<style>.addToDocument()`
* There is now a compile-time check that `styleF` inputs are safe to be stored in a `Map` (which is (by default) what ScalaCss does under-the-hood).
  If you use `styleF` with custom data types, see the new section at the end of [Functional Styles](../features/stylef.md).
* Upgrade dependencies:
  * Scala.JS 0.6.12.
  * Scalatags 0.6.0.
  * scalajs-react 0.11.1
  * scala-js-dom 0.9.1
